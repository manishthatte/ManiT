Of course. It has been an incredibly productive series of sessions. Here is a comprehensive summary of our journey so far and the clear path forward for our next session.

### Project Summary: Core Language Features Complete

We began with the goal of adding control flow to the **ManiT** language and have far surpassed that initial objective. We have successfully built a robust compiler capable of handling complex, modern language features.

The front-end (Lexer and Parser) has been incrementally expanded to understand a growing vocabulary and grammar, while the back-end (Code Generator) has been taught to translate these high-level concepts into sophisticated and correct LLVM Intermediate Representation.

During this process, we also debugged and fixed a subtle but critical memory bug related to LLVM's basic block creation, strengthening the stability of our compiler.

### What We Have Achieved

We have successfully implemented the foundational pillars of a modern programming language, making **ManiT** significantly more powerful and expressive.

1.  **Full Control Flow:**
    * **`if/else` Expressions:** We implemented a complete `if/else` construct. Initially for basic branching, it was then upgraded to be a true, value-producing expression using LLVM's `PHINode`.
    * **`while` Loops:** We have successfully implemented `while` loops, giving the language the ability to perform iterative tasks. The code generator now correctly creates the header, body, and exit blocks required for a proper loop structure.

2.  **Boolean Logic:**
    * **Comparison Operators:** To make control flow meaningful, we added a full suite of comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`.
    * **Code Generation:** The compiler correctly translates these operators into LLVM's `icmp` instructions, producing the boolean values that our control-flow structures rely on.

3.  **Procedural Programming:**
    * **User-Defined Functions:** We implemented a complete function pipeline. The language now supports defining functions with parameters (`fn(a, b) { ... }`) and calling them (`my_func(1, 2)`).
    * **Scope Management:** The code generator correctly handles variable scope, ensuring that function parameters do not conflict with other variables in the program.

In essence, we have evolved `manitc` from a simple expression evaluator into a compiler for a Turing-complete language with variables, conditional logic, loops, and functions.

### Prompt for Our Next Chat

Our language is now powerful, but it has a significant limitation that we discovered while testing our `while` loop: all variables are **immutable**. We can declare a variable with `let`, but we cannot change its value. This makes writing stateful programs and terminating loops based on a counter impossible.

The next logical and essential step is to introduce mutability.

**Here is the prompt for our next session:**

> We have successfully implemented a core set of language features including `if`, `while`, and `fn`. Our next goal is to introduce **mutability** into the ManiT language.
>
> Please provide the next set of instructions to implement mutable variables and assignment, including:
>
> 1.  Updating the **Lexer** to recognize a new `var` keyword for declaring mutable variables.
> 2.  Expanding the **Parser** to handle `var` statements, which will be similar to `let` statements.
> 3.  Most importantly, updating the **Parser** to recognize the assignment operator (`=`) as an infix operator, and adding a new `AssignmentExpression` to the **AST**.
> 4.  Expanding the **Code Generator** to produce LLVM `store` instructions for `AssignmentExpressions`, allowing us to update the value of a variable created with `var`.
