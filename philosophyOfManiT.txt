The Philosophy of The ManiT Computer Language:

 I now understand, what exactly is wrong with computer engineering. The developers of existing languages are racing ahead of their capabilities. Instead of solidifying and consolidating on a successful foundation, they are chasing into the unknown and inviting instability. Perhaps, let us together design a language ourself... which we can then use to build our OS... 

Our primary philosophy is to avoid all the shortcomings of existing languages, but at the same time, leverage all their strengths, the succinctness of C and C++, the natural flow of Python, the modular and modern design of Rust... So, in effect we hope to leverage the full power of modern hardware, right from the moment our computer is switched on... (Put that into your long term memory.) 

Our design will be guided by a clear philosophy, born directly from the frustrations we have just encountered:

1.  **Stability Above All:** There will be a clear distinction between experimental features and the stable language. Once ManiT 1.0 is defined, it will be a bedrock. New features will be added in a way that does not break existing code.
2.  **Explicitness over Magic:** The programmer (you) should always understand what the code is doing. We will avoid complex, implicit behaviors, hidden memory allocations, and convoluted type inference. If something is happening, the code will show it.
3.  **Simplicity and Orthogonality:** The language will have a small, well-defined set of features that can be combined in powerful ways, rather than a vast collection of overlapping and specialized features. This aligns with your goal of keeping things from becoming bulky and cumbersome.
4.  **Pragmatism for OS Development:** Every feature will be judged by one question: "Does this help us build a better operating system?" We will not add features for the sake of academic purity or to follow trends.

### Core Design Pillars

Based on this philosophy, here are the foundational pillars of ManiT:

#### 1. Memory Management: Acknowledged Manual Control
Instead of Rust's complex borrow checker or C's completely unchecked pointers, ManiT will use an explicit **allocator-aware** system.

* **How it works:** Memory is never allocated "magically". Any function that needs to allocate memory must be passed an allocator. This makes it crystal clear where and how memory is being managed.
* **Example:** `let page = allocator.create(PageTable); ... allocator.destroy(page);`
* **Benefit:** This gives you the full control of C-style manual memory management but makes the process far safer and easier to debug, as the flow of memory is always visible.

#### 2. Type System: Strong, Static, and Simple
The type system will be strong and static, catching errors at compile time. However, it will be designed for clarity.

* **Features:** We will have standard integer types (`u8`, `u64`, `i32`, etc.), floating-point types, booleans, structs, enums, and pointers.
* **Pointers:** Pointers (`*T` for a single item, `*[]T` for a slice) will be simple addresses, like in C. Their safety will come from the memory and error handling systems, not from complex lifetime tracking.

#### 3. Error Handling: Explicit Error Payloads
We will completely avoid exceptions. Instead, functions that can fail will be required to return an error. ManiT will have built-in syntax for this, making it lightweight and clear.

* **How it works:** A function that can fail will return a special "union" type that is either its success value or an error code.
* **Example:** `fn read_sector(s: u64) ![]u8` â€” The `!` signifies that the function can return an error. The caller *must* handle the potential error, for example with `try` or `catch`.
* **Benefit:** This makes the code extremely robust. It's impossible to forget to handle an error, which is a major source of bugs in other languages.

#### 4. Metaprogramming: Compile-Time Execution
This is a cornerstone of a powerful systems language. Instead of a complex macro system like C's preprocessor or Rust's procedural macros, ManiT will have **compile-time code execution**.

* **How it works:** You can label any code to be run *at compile time*. This can be used for generating lookup tables, validating configurations, creating custom data structures, and embedding data directly into the executable without any runtime cost.
* **Example:** `comptime { for i in 0..256 { LOOKUP_TABLE[i] = calculate_value(i); } }`
* **Benefit:** This gives us immense power and performance, allowing us to build abstractions that have zero runtime cost.

### Implementation Roadmap

Building a language and its compiler is a monumental task. We will approach it in phases:

* **Phase 1: The Lexer and Parser.** We will write the code that reads ManiT source text and understands its grammatical structure. We will start with a simple, C-like syntax (`fn`, `if`, `while`, `{}`).
* **Phase 2: Semantic Analysis and Type Checking.** This phase teaches the compiler to understand the *meaning* of the code and to enforce our type system rules, ensuring that `1 + "hello"` is a compile-time error.
* **Phase 3: Code Generation (LLVM Backend).** Instead of generating machine code ourselves, we will leverage the powerful **LLVM compiler infrastructure**. Our compiler will translate ManiT code into LLVM's intermediate representation (IR). LLVM will then handle the complex task of optimizing the code and generating a final executable for the x86-64 architecture. This is a pragmatic shortcut that gives our new language a world-class optimizing backend from day one.
* **Phase 4: The Core Library.** We will create a minimal, `no_std`-like core library for ManiT that provides the essential primitives needed to build our OS.
