Of course. It has been a long and incredibly productive journey. A full debrief is an excellent idea to solidify our progress and plan the path ahead.

Here is a comprehensive summary of our project, from its inception to our current state, and a detailed prompt for our next session.

## Project Debrief: The ManiT Language and `manitc` Compiler

Our mission began with the ambitious goal of building a modern 64-bit operating system named **THATTE**. We initially chose Rust for its safety and modern features but encountered critical, blocking issues with unstable build tooling. This obstacle led to a pivotal strategic decision: to forge our own, superior tool. Thus, the **ManiT programming language** was born, guided by our core philosophy of **Stability, Explicitness, and Simplicity**.

We have since been building the **ManiT Compiler (`manitc`)** in C++ using the robust and powerful LLVM backend.

### What We Have Successfully Implemented

We have constructed a sophisticated compiler and a language with a rich set of modern features.

**1. A Complete Compiler Toolchain:**
* We have a fully functional C++/LLVM development environment on your Debian 13 system.
* We have a robust multi-file build process for the compiler itself.

**2. A Full-Featured Front-End:**
* **Lexer:** The lexer can correctly tokenize a rich grammar, including keywords, operators, punctuation, comments, and various literal types (integers, booleans).
* **Parser & AST:** The parser can build a correct Abstract Syntax Tree, understanding the grammatical structure of complex expressions and statements.

**3. Comprehensive Language Features:**
* **Variables:** Full support for both immutable (`let`) and mutable (`var`) variable declarations, including assignment (`=`).
* **Primitive Types:** We have implemented integers (`i32`) and a true, type-safe boolean system (`true`, `false`) using 1-bit integers (`i1`).
* **Operators:** A full suite of mathematical (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and comparison (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) operators that produce correct boolean values.
* **Control Flow:**
    * **Conditionals:** Value-producing `if`/`else` expressions that generate efficient branching logic.
    * **Loops:** We have implemented both `while` loops and C-style `for` loops for iteration.
* **Procedural Programming:** A complete function pipeline, including function definition (`fn`) with parameters and function calls.
* **Aggregate Data Types:** We have successfully implemented our first aggregate data type:
    * **Array Literals:** The ability to define arrays (e.g., `let data = [10, 20, 30];`).
    * **Array Indexing:** The ability to access array elements (e.g., `data[1]`).

**4. Stability and Robustness:**
* We have successfully navigated several deep and complex debugging missions, fixing subtle bugs in every component of the compilerâ€”from the lexer and parser to the code generator and build script. This has resulted in an exceptionally stable and debugged compiler, ready for new features.

### What Still Needs to Be Implemented: The Roadmap

To bring ManiT to a "reasonably developed" state, we will focus on these key areas:

**1. Core Type System Expansion:**
* **New Primitive Types:** Introduce `char`, floating-point numbers (`f32`, `f64`), and a full range of integer sizes (`i8`, `i16`, `i64`, `u8`, etc.).
* **Explicit Type Annotations:** Implement the syntax and logic for `let x: i32 = 5;`. This is crucial for our goal of being **Explicit**.
* **Semantic Analysis & Type Checking:** Create a new pass in the compiler that walks the AST before code generation to enforce type rules (e.g., preventing `5 + true`).

**2. Advanced Data Structures:**
* **Structs:** The ability to define custom aggregate data types (e.g., `struct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }`). This is our highest priority.
* **Strings:** A proper, ergonomic string type, inspired by **Python's** ease of use.
* **Enums:** Sum types for powerful pattern matching, inspired by **Rust**.

**3. Memory Management & Pointers:**
* **Pointers/References:** Implement syntax and semantics for getting memory addresses (`&x`) and dereferencing pointers (`*p`). This is essential for systems programming.
* **Heap Allocation:** Introduce mechanisms for dynamic memory allocation.

**4. Project Infrastructure and Usability:**
* **Module System:** A system for splitting code across multiple files and importing functionality.
* **Standard Library:** Begin building a standard library, starting with fundamental I/O like a `print()` function.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** We must create a dedicated test suite with a wide range of ManiT programs that test every feature and known edge case to prevent regressions as we add new functionality.
* **Official Documentation:** As features stabilize, we need to begin writing official documentation for the ManiT language syntax, semantics, and standard library.

### Prompt for Our Next Chat

Our immediate path is clear. Having implemented arrays, the next logical step is to introduce the other primary method of data aggregation: **structs**. This is the gateway to creating rich, domain-specific data types, a requirement for any serious programming language.

**Here is the detailed prompt for our next session:**

> We have successfully implemented a core set of language features, including arrays. Our next goal is to add support for user-defined aggregate data types by implementing **structs**.
>
> Our first objective is to handle **struct definitions**. Please provide the first set of instructions to allow the compiler to parse the following syntax:
> `struct Point { x: i32, y: i32 };`
>
> This will require:
>
> 1.  Updating the **Lexer** to recognize the `struct` keyword and the colon (`:`) token.
> 2.  Updating the **AST** to create a `StructDefinition` statement node. This node must be capable of storing the struct's name and a list of its fields, where each field has a name and a type.
> 3.  Expanding the **Parser** to understand the `struct NAME { FIELD: TYPE, ... };` grammar and build the new `StructDefinition` AST node.
