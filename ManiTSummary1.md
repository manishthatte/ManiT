Here is a summary of our conversation, detailing our journey, achievements, and the clear path forward for our next session.

### Project Summary: From OS to Language and Back Again

Our initial goal was to design and build a modern 64-bit operating system from scratch named **THATTE**. We began this journey by choosing the **Rust** programming language for its safety and modern features. However, during the environment setup, we encountered significant and persistent dependency conflicts with the build tooling (`bootimage`), which proved to be outdated for our needs.

This frustration led to a pivotal and ambitious decision: instead of fighting with unstable tools, we would forge our own. We have now embarked on creating a new, purpose-built programming language named **ManiT**.

The core philosophy of ManiT, which I have committed to memory, is to be a language of **Stability, Explicitness, and Simplicity**. It is designed to avoid the shortcomings of existing languages while leveraging their strengths, with the ultimate goal of being the perfect tool for building the **THATTE** OS.

### What We Have Achieved

We have made remarkable progress and successfully built the foundational stages of the **ManiT Compiler (`manitc`)** in C++ using the powerful LLVM backend.

1.  **Compiler Environment:** We have a fully configured and working C++/LLVM development environment on your Debian 13 system, capable of building our compiler.

2.  **Language Definition:** We have defined the core vocabulary (tokens) and the initial grammar for the ManiT language.

3.  **Compiler Front End (Complete):** We have successfully built the entire "front end" of the compiler, which is responsible for *understanding* ManiT code.
    * **Lexer:** `manitc` can read a string of ManiT code and correctly break it down into a stream of tokens (keywords, operators, numbers, etc.).
    * **Parser:** `manitc` can take this stream of tokens and build an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**. This demonstrates that our compiler understands the grammatical structure of the code, including:
        * Variable declarations (`let` statements).
        * `return` statements.
        * Complex mathematical expressions with correct operator precedence (e.g., `5 + 10 * 2`).

4.  **Compiler Back End (Foundation Built):** We have successfully built the initial "back end" of the compiler, which translates the AST into low-level code.
    * **Code Generator:** `manitc` can "walk" the AST and generate valid **LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR)**. This is a huge milestone, as it proves we can translate the abstract *meaning* of our ManiT code into a format that is one step away from executable machine code.

In essence, we have created a functional compiler that can take a program like `let result = 5 + 10 * 2; return -result;` and correctly translate it into optimized, low-level IR.

### Prompt for Our Next Chat

Our work on the ManiT compiler is well underway, but the language is not yet complete enough to build an operating system. Our immediate path is to continue adding essential features.

**Here is the prompt for our next session:**

> We have successfully built the `manitc` compiler, which can parse `let` statements, `return` statements, and mathematical expressions, generating LLVM IR.
>
> Our next goal is to expand the ManiT language to include **control flow**. Please provide the next set of instructions to implement **`if`/`else` expressions** into our compiler, including:
>
> 1.  Updating the Lexer to recognize any new tokens.
> 2.  Updating the AST to represent `if`/`else` structures.
> 3.  Expanding the Parser to understand the grammar of these new expressions.
> 4.  Expanding the Code Generator to produce the correct conditional branching logic in LLVM IR.
