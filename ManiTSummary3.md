## Project Debrief: Achieving Compiler Stability

Our initial goal was to add a `while` loop to the ManiT language. This seemingly simple task uncovered a cascade of deep and subtle bugs, leading us on an extensive debugging mission that ultimately touched every single component of our compiler.

### The Problem
We were plagued by a persistent **segmentation fault** that occurred whenever the compiler tried to process code containing a `while` loop.

### Our Debugging Journey
We systematically investigated and fixed issues throughout the compilation pipeline:
1.  **Code Generator:** We first suspected the LLVM IR generation. We corrected the logic for creating basic blocks to ensure they were always correctly parented to their function. The crash persisted.
2.  **Instrumentation:** To gain visibility, we added extensive logging to the compiler and modified our build script to capture the output. This was the turning point.
3.  **The Parser (First Pass):** The logs revealed that the parser was creating the wrong Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node. It was misinterpreting `while (...)` as a `CallExpression`, which pointed to a flaw in its parsing logic.
4.  **The Lexer (The Root Cause):** After fixing the parser, the bug *still* remained. A full rebuild proved the issue was deeper. The logs eventually revealed the true root cause: the **Lexer** was not correctly identifying the `"while"` string as a keyword, instead passing a generic `IDENTIFIER` token to the parser.
5.  **Secondary Bugs:** Fixing the lexer uncovered even more issues that had been masked by the primary bug:
    * The lexer could not handle **comments** (`//`), which was corrupting the token stream and confusing the parser.
    * The parser's token consumption logic was fragile, leading to an **infinite loop** under certain conditions.
6.  **Cleanup:** After fixing all bugs and achieving a stable build, we removed all diagnostic code from the compiler and build scripts, fixing a final minor compilation error caused by a missing header file.

### The Result
We now have a **stable, robust, and debugged compiler**. It correctly handles `let`, `if/else`, functions, and `while` loops. The foundation is solid and ready for new features.

## The Path Forward: Mutability

With the compiler stable, we can finally resume our original task, which is essential for making loops useful: introducing mutable variables.

Here is the prompt for our next session:

We have successfully stabilized the compiler. Our next goal is to introduce **mutability** into the ManiT language.

Please provide the next set of instructions to implement mutable variables and assignment, including:
1.  Updating the **AST** by adding a `VarStatement` node for mutable variable declarations.
2.  Expanding the **Parser** to recognize and parse `var` statements (e.g., `var x = 10;`).
3.  Expanding the **Code Generator** to handle `VarStatement` nodes. This will involve generating a mutable `alloca` instruction and distinguishing it from the immutable variables created by `let`.
